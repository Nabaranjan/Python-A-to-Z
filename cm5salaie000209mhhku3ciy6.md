## **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

**It** is the field of computer science focused on creating systems or machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, decision-making, natural language understanding, and pattern recognition.

AI is divided into 3 types and these are :

1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)
    
2. General AI (Strong AI)
    
3. Super AI
    

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on algorithms and models that learn patterns from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. It’s broadly categorized into:

1. Supervised Learning
    
2. Unsupervised Learning
    
3. Reinforcement Learning
    

## Algorithms

A **Machine Learning (ML) algorithm** is a set of instructions or mathematical models that allow computers to learn patterns from data, make predictions, and improve over time.

**Examples of Supervised Learning Algorithms:**

1. Linear Regression
    
2. Logistic Regression
    
3. Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net Algorithms
    
4. Support Vector Machines
    
5. Naïve Bayes theorem
    
6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm
    
7. Decision Tree
    
8. Random Forest
    
9. Adaboost
    
10. Gradient Boosting
    
11. xgboost
    

**Examples of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:**

1. PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
    
2. K Means Clustering
    
3. Hierarichal Clustering
    
4. DBSCAN Algorithm
    

## Data

Data is a collection of raw materials. Data used in ML is Structured and Unstructured Data.

## Model

An ML model is the output of a training process, representing learned patterns in the data.

## Model Fitting

**Model fitting** in machine learning refers to the process of training a machine learning algorithm on a dataset to learn the underlying patterns or relationships between the input features (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable)

## Training Data

The subset of data used to train the ML model. It includes inputs (features) and their corresponding outputs (labels).

## Test Data

A separate dataset is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

## Supervised Learning

A type of ML where models are trained on labeled data, i.e., data with known input-output pairs.

## Unsupervised Learning

A type of ML where models learn patterns or structures in data without labeled outputs.

## Reinforcement Learning

A learning method where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

## Feature (Input, Independent Variable, Predictor)

A measurable property or characteristic of the data used as input for a model.

## Feature Engineering

The process of transforming raw data into meaningful features to improve model performance.

## Feature Scaling (Normalization, Standardization)

Adjusting the range of feature values to bring them to a similar scale.

* **Normalization**: Scales data to a range of \[0, 1\].
    
* **Standardization**: Centers data around the mean with unit variance.
    

## Dimensionality

The number of features (variables) in a dataset.

## Target (Output, Label, Dependent Variable)

The variable a model is trained to predict in supervised learning.

## Instance (Example, Observation, Sample)

A single data point in a dataset.

## Label (Class, Target Value)

The ground truth or actual output value is associated with an instance in supervised learning.

## Model Complexity

The capacity of a model to capture patterns. High complexity can lead to overfitting, while low complexity may lead to underfitting.

## Bias & Variance

* **Bias**: Error due to overly simplistic models (underfitting).
    
* **Variance**: Error due to model sensitivity to small fluctuations in training data (overfitting).
    

## Noise

Irrelevant or random variations in data that don’t represent true patterns.

## Overfitting & Underfitting

* **Overfitting**: When a model learns patterns specific to the training data, performing poorly on new data.
    
* **Underfitting**: When a model fails to learn the patterns in the data.
    

## Validation & Cross-Validation

* **Validation**: Process of assessing model performance on a validation set.
    
* **Cross-Validation**: Divides the dataset into folds to train and test the model multiple times for robust evaluation
    

## Regularization

Techniques (e.g., L1, L2) that constrain model complexity to reduce overfitting.

## Batch, Epoch, Iteration

* **Batch**: Subset of the training data used in one pass of optimization.
    
* **Epoch**: One complete cycle through the entire training dataset.
    
* **Iteration**: A single update of model parameters.
    

## Parameter

Model-specific values learned during training (e.g., weights in a neural network).

## Hyperparameter

Values set before training that control the learning process (e.g., learning rate, number of layers).

## Cost Function (Loss Function, Objective Function)

A function that measures how well a model's predictions match the actual outputs. Examples:

* **MSE** for regression, **Cross-Entropy Loss** for classification.
    

## Gradient Descent

An optimization algorithm is used to minimize the cost function by updating model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent.

## Learning Rate

Controls the step size in updating model parameters during gradient descent.

## Evaluation

The process of assessing a trained model’s performance using metrics like:

* **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score** (for classification).
    
* **RMSE, MAE** (for regression).
